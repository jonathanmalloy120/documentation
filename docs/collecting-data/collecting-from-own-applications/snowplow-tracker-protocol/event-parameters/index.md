title: "Event type and ID parameters"
---

In the tracker protocol, each event is denoted by an `e=...` parameter.

There are 3 categories of events:

- Standard events, such as page views and page pings
- Custom self-describing events based on a [schema](/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/schemas/index.md)
- Legacy custom structured events, which we don’t recommend using

| **Type of tracking**                                         | **Event type (value of `e`)** |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| [Self-describing event](#self-describing-events)     | `ue`                          |
| [Pageview tracking](#page-views)                      | `pv`                          |
| [Page pings](#page-pings)                                    | `pp`                          |
| [Ecommerce transaction tracking](#transaction-tracking)    | `tr` and `ti`                 |
| [Custom structured event](#structured-event-tracking)        | `se`                          |

| **Parameter** | **Table Column**           | **Type** | **Description**  | **Example values**                     |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `e`           | `event`               | text     | Event type       | (See table [above](#snowplow-events))           |
| `eid`         | `event_id`            | text     | Event UUID       | `606adff6-9ccc-41f4-8807-db8fdb600df8` |

:::caution

Every line of data passed from the tracker should contain an event field (`e`) to denote the type of event being tracked (See the [events section](#snowplow-events) for possible values).

:::

:::info

The event ID (`eid`) is the unique identifier (UUID) for this row. This should be generated by trackers, but if missing will be generated by the enrichment process.

:::

### Reserved parameters

`u` is a reserved parameter because it is used for [click tracking in the Pixel Tracker](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/pixel-tracker/index.md#click-tracking).

:::caution

When the event is sent from a Snowplow tracker, all parameters should be stringified. Those strings are parsed back to their actual type during [Enrichment](/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/enrichment-components/index.md).
